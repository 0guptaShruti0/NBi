The .nunit file is used by NUnit to load a NUnit project. In the case of NBi, **this file references the configuration file and a dll from the NBi framework**.

It contains three important information:

* The appbase: The root directory, other paths will be relative to the directory specified in this attribute
* The configfile: Relative path to the [config file](../installation-config)
* The assembly path: Relative path to NBi framework

This file can be generated by NUnit project editor (provided with NUnit) or alternatively by any xml or text editor editor.

## Xml or text editor

Open the project file with your favorite editor. The content should be :
{% highlight xml %}
<NUnitProject>
  <Settings activeconfig="Default" processModel="Default" domainUsage="Default" />
  <Config
    name="Default"
    binpathtype="Auto" appbase="..\"
    configfile="MyTestProject\MyTestProject.config">
    <assembly path="Framework\NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll" />
  </Config>
</NUnitProject>
{% endhighlight %}

## NUnit project editor

Execute NUnit.exe and create a new project with *File > New Project* (save it as *MyTests/MyTestProject/MyTestProject.nunit*).

![Save project](../../img/docs/installation-nunit-project/save-project.png)

Edit the project *Project > Edit*

![Edit project](../../img/docs/installation-nunit-project/edit-project.png)

and reference the *AppBase* as the parent-folder. All paths in this file and the *config* file are related to this *AppBase* path.

Then the *config file* as "MyTestProject\MyTestProject.config‚Äù.

![AppBase and config file](../../img/docs/installation-nunit-project/appbase-config.png)

In the tab assemblies, click to add a new assembly to the project.

![Add an assembly](../../img/docs/installation-nunit-project/add-assembly.png)

reference the NBi.NUnit.Runtime.dll from the folder *framework* (others dll in the same directory will automatically been found by NUnit and loaded when required).

![Select the correct assembly](../../img/docs/installation-nunit-project/nbi-assembly.png)

This dll should be the only dll referenced in your project.
