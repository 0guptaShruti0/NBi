the *trait* element provides a generalized approach to set named properties on any test-case or group of test-cases, using a name/value pair.

In the example below, the test is given a *severity* value of *high* and a *debug-tip* of *run in SSMS*.

{% highlight xml %}
<test name="...">
  <trait name="severity">high</trait>
  <trait name="debug-tip">run in SSMS</trait>
  ....
</test>
{% endhighlight %}

These traits are not used for any purpose by the framework itself but are displayed in the report generated by NUnit and available in the *Test Properties* dialog of the UI.
